The Hubble Space Telescope has made its first observation of the chemical 

makeup of a distant quasar that may yield clues to the makeup of the early 

universe, NASA officials said Sunday. 

</P>

<P>

Using the telescope's Faint Object Spectrograph, astronomers from the National 

Aeronautics and Space Administration, Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and 

UC San Diego observed the spectrum of a faint quasar, called UM675, about 12 

billion light years from Earth. 

</P>

<P>

(A light year is the distance light travels in one year, or about 186,000 

miles.) 

</P>

<P>

Quasars, the brightest objects in the universe, emit energy that seems too 

intense to come from a source so compact. Although quasars were discovered in 

1963, scientists still understand little about them. 

</P>

<P>

E. Margaret Burbidge, the UC San Diego astronomer who led the team, said that 

one purpose of the eight-hour observation was to look for the "signature" of 

helium in the far ultraviolet spectrum. 

</P>

<P>

The strength of that helium signature, after analysis, should reveal something 

about how much helium existed in the early universe, Burbidge said. 

</P>

<P>

Helium is the second most abundant element in the universe, but scientists say 

that not all of it could have come from the stars' nuclear fusion, which 

transforms hydrogen to helium. So it has been theorized that most of the helium 

came from the "big bang" explosion that some astronomers think created the 

universe about 15 billion years ago. 

</P>

<P>

The part of a quasar's radiation that includes the main spectral lines produced 

by helium cannot be picked up by a ground-based telescope because it is blocked 

by Earth's ozone layer.

FOR THE RECORD 

</P>

<P>

Light-years -- A United Press International story on the Hubble Space 

Telescope, printed in The Times' Monday editions, contained an inaccurate 

figure for the distance of a light-year. The correct distance that light 

travels in one year in a vacuum is about 5.9 trillion miles.
