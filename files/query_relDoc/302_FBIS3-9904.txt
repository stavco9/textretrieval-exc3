  [Editorial Report] The following is a compilation of 

fileworthy reports on economic developments in Cuba carried on 

Havana radio and television in Spanish between 22 and 25 

February. 

  Radio Rebelde at 0000 GMT on 22 February reports that eight 

Havana universities will initiate graduate level summer schools 

to run from 20 June to 19 August. According to Deputy Minister 

of Education Rodolfo Alarcon Ortiz, the courses will be open to 

foreign students, whose tuition will supplement university 

income. 

  Radio Reloj in its 2030-3100 GMT newscast on 22 February 

reports the following: 

  Two new centers for making biological pesticides have been 

inaugurated in Sancti Spiritus Province. The centers are part of 

a project financed by the nongovernmental organization "Bread 

for the World" and are located in the Banao area in Sancti 

Spiritus Municipality and on the Nueva Cuba 

Agricultural-Livestock Production Cooperative in Cabaiguan. 

  Cuba and the Dominican Republic have signed a sports 

cooperation agreement whereby Cuban swimming and track and field 

trainers will offer their knowledge to Dominican athletes as of 

March. The agreement provides for consulting by Cuban trainers 

in other sports as well. 

  Guantanamo is to have a provincial biopharmaceutical 

laboratory as of next month, for the production of medicines and 

vaccines for humans and animals. 

  "Camaguey construction workers have built works worth some 

77 

million pesos. This figure represents a drop of slightly over 50 

percent compared to 1989." Over 1,300 low-cost houses were 

finished in 1993. Only 500 of these were built by organizations 

belonging to the sector itself, "which does not correspond to 

the resources and means that the Ministry of Construction has at 

its disposal, as manager of these investments." 

  Cuba Vision Network at 2320 GMT on 22 February reports that 

self- sufficiency and service granges are being formed in 

high-potential municipalities in Havana Province at the 

initiative of the Cuban Government and the Communist Party of 

Cuba. "These granges are to become suppliers for nearby towns, 

gastronomic units, and workers' dining rooms." Ten Havana 

Province municipalities are to have such structures in marginal 

lands, with a view to solving the demand for such production in 

the area. Also, three new tourist installations have been 

inaugurated in Holguin Province: a marina in Boca de Sama [Bay]; 

a new restaurant, El Fuerte, in Guarda la Vaca; and the La Roca 

nightclub. 

  Radio Rebelde at 1255 GMT on 23 February reports that as 

part 

of the solidarity with Cuba campaign being carried out in 

Canada, the ship Energy arrived in Cuba bringing donations 

estimated at $250,000. The donations include 10 containers with 

some 80 tons of specialized medical equipment, bicycles, papers, 

and wheelchairs. 

  Cuba Vision at 0200 GMT on 23 February reports that in the 

last 32 years over 221 million vaccination doses have been 

distributed in Cuba. This resulted in the elimination of polio 

in 1962, diphtheria in 1969, neonatal tetanus in 1972; there 

were only two cases of whooping cough reported in 1993. There 

have been no cases of measles in 18 months. There were fewer 

than 10 cases each of rubella and mumps in 1993. Meningitis was 

widespread in the 80's but there were only 69 cases in 1993. 

  Radio Rebelde at 1800 GMT on 23 February reports that 

representatives from more than 20 countries are participating in 

the Computing-94 conference being held at the Havana Convention 

Center. Computer Science Expert (Arturo Rivagorda), who is also 

chairman of the Spanish national association of computer 

security systems, in stressing the importance of this 

conference, said that the efforts being made in this area are 

the same as those being made worldwide and that Cuba can 

perfectly well become integrated with countries of other 

regions, including Europe. 

  Cuba Vision at 2320 GMT on 23 February reports that the 

Labor 

Union of the Banco Popular Espanol made a donation to the 

campaign for the children of Chernobyl receiving treatment in 

Cuba. Workers donate 1 percent of their wages; so far, they have 

collected $4,000. 

  Radio Reloj at 1530 GMT on 25 February reports that members 

of the National Association of Innovators and Efficiency Experts 

in Santiago de Cuba have managed to establish a new system to be 

added to the irrigation system that will help cut fuel by 13 

percent. The provincial board has thus declared that this new 

system will be added to all equipment with Motor A-41 during the 

first quarter of this year.
