Two young men did not kill themselves because they heard alleged subliminal 

messages in the heavy metal music of Judas Priest, a judge in Reno, Nev., ruled 

on Friday. 

</P>

<P>

Judas Priest vocalist Rob Halford called the ruling a victory for rock 'n' 

roll. 

</P>

<P>

"It's a great day for Judas Priest. It's a great day for heavy metal and 

artistic expression," Halford said in a telephone interview from Mexico, where 

he is vacationing. "Still, my main worry is that it seems as if the judge may 

have left the door open on subliminal messages." 

</P>

<P>

Lawyers representing the families of two Sparks, Nev., youths in the 

product-liability suit claimed a subliminal command saying "Do it" and backward 

messages promoting self-destruction concealed in Judas Priest's 1978 album 

"Stained Class" caused Raymond Belknap, 18, and James Vance, 20, to attempt 

suicide. Belknap died instantly, Vance three years later. 

</P>

<P>

In a 93-page decision, Washoe District Judge Jerry Whitehead said he could hear 

the subliminal commands, but that the words "Do it" were the result of a chance 

combination of the singer's exhalation of breath and a "Leslie" guitar sound. 

He also ruled that the families of the two young men failed to prove that such 

messages were a precipitating factor in the shootings. 

</P>

<P>

Judas Priest and CBS Records, the band's record company, denied using 

subliminal messages. 

</P>

<P>

In his conclusion, Whitehead specified that the defendants could not claim 

victory, as they failed to prove that subliminal stimuli have no effect on 

human behavior. 

</P>

<P>

"Rather," Whitehead wrote, "plaintiffs lost this case because they failed to 

prove that the defendants intentionally placed subliminal messages on the album 

and that those messages were a cause of the suicide and attempted suicide 

involved in this case. However, it is unknown what future information, research 

and technology will bring to this field." 

</P>

<P>

The ruling, which attorneys for the families say they will probably not appeal, 

leaves open the door on a broad new category of product-liability lawsuits, 

according to one of the attorneys in the case. Kenneth McKenna, who represented 

one of the mothers of the dead youths, said he already has several similar 

cases on tap in other states. 

</P>

<P>

"I believe this is an excellent decision because it should promote people to 

pursue more of these cases in the future," McKenna said. "Sooner or later, 

science is going to catch up with reality and we'll be able to prove these 

cases in a courtroom." 

</P>

<P>

While the judge ruled in favor of the band and CBS Records, in an 18-page 

collateral order that was part of the ruling he imposed a $40,000 "sanction" 

against the record company, saying it had refused to comply with court orders 

directing it to supply certain materials needed to decide the case. 

</P>

<P>

Gail Edwin, vice president and litigation counsel for CBS Records, said the 

company complied with every court order and was reviewing the Friday order to 

determine how to proceed. 

</P>

<P>

Belknap's mother, Aunetta Roberson, said she was pleased that the judge found 

that the subliminal messages existed. 

</P>

<P>

"I hope this case will cause other mothers to begin paying attention to what 

their kids are listening to," she said. 

</P>

<P>

Vance's mother, Phyllis Vance, said she is writing a book about the incident 

and intends to continue counseling families who have encountered problems 

allegedly due to heavy metal music. 

</P>

<P>

"I have to accept what the judge said," Vance said. "I was never in it for the 

money. My intention was to get the word out about heavy metal, and I plan to 

continue helping kids hurt by this music." 

</P>

<P>

The unprecedented case, which sparked international attention, stemmed from the 

Dec. 23, 1985, suicide attempts of Belknap and Vance. 

</P>

<P>

After an afternoon of beer drinking, pot smoking and listening to Judas Priest 

music, the two youths demolished Belknap's bedroom, grabbed a 12-gauge 

sawed-off shotgun and jumped out the window . 

</P>

<P>

According to an account by Vance, Belknap dashed to the playground of a local 

church, sat down on a merry-go-round, jammed the muzzle of the weapon under his 

chin and pulled the trigger. Vance followed suit. 

</P>

<P>

Belknap died on the spot. Vance's self-inflicted blast tore away his nose, 

cheeks, jaw, tongue, teeth and gums. Horribly disfigured, he survived three 

years of excruciating plastic surgery before lapsing into an unexplained coma. 

He died in November, 1989. 

</P>

<P>

In December 1985, Vance implied that the suicide attempts were a result of 

depression. He never mentioned Judas Priest's music, according to police 

reports. Vance told authorities that he shot himself out of panic, fearing that 

he would be blamed for his friend's shooting and might subsequently face arrest 

and prosecution, according to the reports. 

</P>

<P>

But in March 1986, Vance changed his story, according to police reports. He 

introduced the concept of a suicide pact and suggested that he believed a 

volatile combination of drugs, alcohol and Judas Priest music led the two to 

shoot themselves. 

</P>

<P>

Between March 1986 and October 1988, Vance cited specific lyrics from the song 

"Beyond the Realms of Death" as a motivating factor in the shootings, according 

to court records. 

</P>

<P>

When the parents of the dead youths first filed their case in 1986, they 

alleged that violent and suicidal themes present in "Realms" and other Judas 

Priest songs on the 1978 "Stained Class"album impelled their sons to attempt 

suicide. 

</P>

<P>

But in October 1988 -- shortly after a similar suicide suit filed in Sacramento 

against rock star Ozzy Osbourne was dismissed by the California District Court 

of Appeals on the grounds that Osbourne's music and lyrics were protected by 

the First Amendment -- attorneys for the parents amended their original 

complaint. 

</P>

<P>

They alleged that the specific subliminal command "Do it" had been embedded in 

a different Judas Priest song, "Better by You, Better Than Me," and that 

subliminal message, in combination with the record's allegedly overt violent 

and self-destructive imagery, precipitated the suicide attempt. 

</P>

<P>

In a landmark 54-page ruling written last August and partially excerpted in 

Friday's ruling, Whitehead said that although the court respected the First 

Amendment right of artists to express themselves, he declined to dismiss the 

case because he believed that subliminal messages do not share such privileges. 

</P>

<P>

The judge suggested that subliminal communication is not protected because it 

does not advance any of the purposes of free speech and because it is a 

violation of privacy deviously employed to manipulate the subconscious mind. 

</P>

<P>

As the trial progressed, the plaintiffs also accused the band of inserting a 

broad array of backward slogans promoting suicide throughout the album. 

</P>

<P>

Attorneys for Judas Priest argued that the shootings were motivated by a 

barrage of complex social and psychological problems -- including unstable 

family environments, poor academic performance, drug abuse and a history of 

violent and dysfunctional behavior -- which allegedly plagued the two young men 

since childhood. 

</P>

<P>

Originally seeking $3.6 million in damages to compensate for the deaths, 

medical bills and support for a child Vance fathered after the suicide attempt, 

attorneys for the plaintiffs upped the ante to $6.2 million in their closing 

arguments. 

</P>

<P>

The ruling came after a trial that lasted 17 days and included testimony from 

more than 40 witnesses, including psychologists, authors, lecturers, subliminal 

tape entrepreneurs and sound analysts.
