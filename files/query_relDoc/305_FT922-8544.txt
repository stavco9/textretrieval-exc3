COMPANY-OWNED cars are about 30 per cent more likely to be involved in

accidents that cause death or injury than similar cars owned privately,

according to a Department of Transport report published yesterday.

This is partly explained by the higher annual mileages of company cars, says

the report. It also shows that high-performance cars are twice as likely to

be involved in fatal accidents as 'ordinary' versions of the same cars.

This supports the tough line being taken by insurance companies against

'hot' hatchbacks and similar vehicles. Premiums for such cars have risen

sharply under a revised pricing structure introduced by the Association of

British Insurers. However, the increases reflect much higher theft rates as

well as accidents.

A breakdown of all accidents in 1990 showed the BMW 3 series, Volkswagen

Golf GTi, Astra GTE and Ford Escort XR3i among those more likely to be in

serious crashes. Pre-1988 models were the worst, with 63 fatal or serious

accidents per 10,000 vehicles.

Among small cars, the risk of driver injury in an accident was highest for

the Rover Mini and lowest for an early version of the Nissan Cherry; in the

small/medium sector highest-risk cars were the 'old' Ford Escort, Triumph

Acclaim and Vauxhall Chevette, with VW Golfs the lowest risk. In the

medium-car sector, those most at risk were Ford Sierra Sapphire and Cortina

drivers, and least at risk were Renault 21 drivers. The highest risk in the

larger-car sector was the Saab 900, and lowest the Rover 800.

Among the main company cars surveyed, Ford's Sierra hatchback had the

highest injury risk and the Vauxhall Cavalier the lowest.
