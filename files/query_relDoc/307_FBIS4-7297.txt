  [Text] Thailand has rejected China's proposal to sell 

electricity that would be generated from seven large-scale 

hydroelectric projects to be built in southern China, opposite 

the Kingdom's northern region. 

  Senior officials of the Yunnan power utilities made the 

proposal to the Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand 

(EGAT) which rejected it out of hand because the Thai body views 

the undertaking as not economically viable. 

  EGAT's rejection could restrict the southern Chinese 

authorities' ambitious plan to develop hydroelectric plants 

along the Manwan River (Lan Xan in Thai) which offers a massive 

generating potential of 19,000 megawatts (MW). 

  Yunnan wants to establish Thailand as a major market for its 

electricity exports, aside from supplying the power from the 

proposed schemes to Canton [as published], the other 

economically vibrant southern area. It initially offered to 

supply 500 MW to EGAT. 

  It also aborted the effort by a group of Thai companies 

which 

had been seeking to play a key part in the investment and 

development of those hydroelectric schemes to meet Thailand's 

explosive growth in electricity demand, now growing at 10-12 

percent a year. 

  Senior EGAT officials said their rejection was based on two 

reasons. First, there was sufficient indigenous power supplies 

in northern Thailand generated by EGAT's huge lignite-fired Mae 

Moh power complex and therefore, supplies from China would be 

redundant. 

  Secondly, importing and transmitting the Chinese electricity 

to central Thailand would be limited by prohibitive costs. The 

length of the transmission line involved would be some 1,000 km, 

they said. 

  As far as the importation of electricity from neighbouring 

countries is concerned, EGAT appears to give a higher priority 

on importing power from Laos and much preparation is underway in 

this direction. 

  Last June, the Thai government through EGAT had signed a 

memorandum of understanding with the Lao government for 

Vientiane to supply up to 1,500 MW of electricity to the Kingdom 

by the turn of the century. 

  Laos has recently signed a memorandum of understanding with 

an international consortium for it to develop a major 

hydroelectric project in Laos as part of the June memorandum. 

  The consortium will invest US$1 billion to develop the Nam 

Thuen T1 hydroelectric plant with a generating capacity of 600 

MW to be entirely exported to Thailand under terms which have 

vet to be agreed upon.
