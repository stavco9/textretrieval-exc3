  [Text] Santa Fe de Bogota, 28 Feb (DPA) -- Today, 

Colombian Prosecutor General Gustavo de Greiff said the U.S. 

Government is not interested in supplying evidence to condemn 

the chiefs of the drug trafficking mafia because it does not 

trust Colombian justice. In this manner, De Greiff reaffirmed 

the difficulties his office has encountered in its attempt to 

collect evidence in the United States against the main "capos" 

of the Cali cartel, several of whom have expressed their desire 

to surrender and collaborate with authorities. "Colombia is 

being deserted. The United States is not interested in 

collaborating with Colombian justice although there are judicial 

exchange agreements," De Greiff pointed out. 

  The prosecutor general added that U.S. authorities are 

"withholding evidence" to reveal later should the mafiosos be 

captured in their country without taking into account that 

several of them are thinking about surrendering in Colombia. In 

the opinion of the director of the Colombian justice system, the 

government in Washington should change its strategy of 

withholding evidence and "open its doors" to criminals who wish 

to surrender and supply valuable information to defeat drug 

trafficking. 

  De Greiff confirmed that his office is still in touch with 

lawyers who claim to represent Gilberto Rodriguez, charged with 

being the leader of the Cali cartel, as part of a rapprochement 

process, started last year and intensified in the past weeks. 

Talks between De Greiff and these lawyers have developed so 

smoothly that the prosecutor general and the media are not 

ruling out the possibility that Rodriguez, who is known by the 

alias of "El Ajedrecista," might surrender in mid-March. 

According to official reports, Rodriguez wants to take advantage 

of the decrees President Cesar Gaviria signed in 1990 offering 

substantial sentence reductions to drug traffickers and 

terrorists who surrender, confess to at least one crime, and 

effectively collaborate with the authorities. 

  Spokesmen for the Prosecutor General's Office claim that one 

of the difficulties facing this process is the lack of evidence 

to indict the mafiosos because many of the charges made in the 

past were leveled by the media and cannot be confirmed. Three 

men charged with being Cali cartel leaders appeared before the 

Prosecutor General's Office in mid-January but were not held 

because there were no warrants for their arrest.
